# Minor Video Editing Tasks in Premiere Pro

I understand anybody might just come across this repo, but if you are a Lambda student or staff, I ask that you please don't share this with the general public.   Lambda folks need every leg up they can get!

Let's say you have a video, and you want to make some minor edits to it.  This portion of the how-to is focused on Premiere Pro, but there are many other video-editing software options out there, so feel free to use the one you're most comfortable with.  This is the one I know how to do a few things in, so this is the one I am showing you how to work in.
