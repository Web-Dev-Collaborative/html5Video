I understand anybody might just come across this repo, but if you are a Lambda student or staff, I ask that you please don't share this with the general public.   Lambda folks need every leg up they can get!

## Notes

- This is a file with directions and tips on how to set up all your stuff to record this video.  This is how I did it, but might not be how you end up doing it.  Hopefully it will give you a good starting point in case you are a total noob coming into this like I was.

## What You Need

- your favorite coding editor (optional)
- your favorite browser (optional)
- deployed projects you want to show off
- code files and chunks of code you want to show off
- script for this video
- PowerPoint or your favorite presentation software
- Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or your favorite recording software
- This is ***a lot*** easier with two screens.  If you do not have two screens, you will need your script on paper or on your phone or basically not on the screen you're sharing.

## Directions

- ***VERY IMPORTANT***:  Don't put this video in your GitHub repo because GitHub repos only accept files up to 100mb and your video is likely going to be well over that.
- First, before you write your script or do anything with related to this video, you want to figure out the structure or outline of your video.  You will use the structure/outline to write your script and make your PowerPoint presentation.  
- Write your script.  Since you did an outline/structure first, you can write each respective portion of the script from your outline in any order and won't have the write the script from beginning to end.  It will also keep you organized and focused on time, because you also want to be as concise as possible.
- Suggestion:  Write your outline and script in a separate file and don't paste it into the notes section of PowerPoint until it's totally done.
- Create your PowerPoint presentation.
  - Suggestion:  Use a template or make a theme that matches your portfolio/etc. branding, same fonts, same colors, etc.
  - Suggestion:  If you use an avatar for yourself in your presentation instead of the actual video of you, you don't have to worry about where you're looking while talking.  
  - Suggestion:  It might or might not be helpful to have an empty slide at the beginning of the PowerPoint presentation for logistical purposes of clipping video later.  This isn't required to make a good video, but you might find it easier to edit the video if you do include one at the beginning.
- Paste the script you wrote slide by slide into the notes section of your PowerPoint presentation.  That slide's notes will be visible while your slide show is playing, so you will be able to read from it while recording.
  - Commentary:  When you do the slide show, you'll have your actual slide show on the screen you're sharing and the PowerPoint window with notes showing on the other screen that you are NOT sharing.  Then while you're recording and talking, as you click to go to each next slide, the notes for that slide will automatically be displayed and you can just keep talking w/o having to memorize any of your script.
  - Suggestion:  Make an empty slide within your presentation for each and every time you need to switch to a deployed project or code window, and paste the portion of your script in the notes of that empty slide that you're going to say while showing the deployed project or code.  When you exit the slide show, your PowerPoint window will still be on that slide on the screen you're NOT sharing, and it will have the 'empty slide' showing, so you'll still be able to read from the notes for that particular slide just fine.
- Open up all the files you'll be showing in your video on the screen you're going to record.  Open them up backwards, meaning, open the last file you'll be showing off in the overall presentation FIRST, the next to last file you're showing off SECOND, etc., and the first file you're showing off should be the one you open up LAST.  
  - In this way, these open project/code windows will cascade in the order you are going to talk about them and, as you close each one, the very next one you want will already be open and waiting for you to talk about it.  
- Open your PowerPoint presentation in the window you're NOT sharing.  Run the slide show briefly and make sure it does the actual slide show in the screen you'll be sharing.

***IMPORTANT***:  If your computer is not powerful enough to do everything in one swipe, like have all the windows open that you need, record it in smaller chunks and insert one chunk into the other later.  Then you only need to have open what you're actually recording, and you can do it in chunks.

### Recording on Different Platforms

Now we're going to record.  I've done directions for both Zoom and Microsoft Teams since that's what I personally know how to do, but you obviously can use whatever you want.

#### Zoom

- Open up Zoom.
- Click ```New Meeting```.
- Click ```Start Video``` if you will be recording yourself and are not using an avatar.
- Click ```Share Screen``` and share whichever screen you have all the open windows in.
- Check the box ```Optimize Screen Sharing For Video Clip```.
- Click ```More``` in the Zoom toolbar that appears after you share.
- Click ```Record```.
- Start your PowerPoint slide show.  It should appear in the window you're sharing because you already checked it earlier.
- If you have an empty slide as I suggested, wait for a few seconds of silence and then start talking when you're ready.  Click to go to the next slide as you finish talking about each slide or window.
- Hit the ```esc``` key to exit the PowerPoint slide when you need to show a different window.
- The app/code you need should be the top window and, in theory, you shouldn't need to do much traversing between apps/windows while recording.
- Finish recording your video.  This may take several tries.
- Click ```Stop Recording```.
- Click ```Leave Meeting```.
- It will spend some time converting.
- When it's done, in Zoom, go to ```settings```, then ```recording```, then note where your ```local recordings``` are on your computer.  That's where you can get the video you just recorded.

#### Microsoft Teams

- Open up Teams.  Sign in if you need to.
- In the top right-hand corner, click ```meet```.
- Name it whatever you want.
- Make sure your audio is on and also video if you're not using an avatar.
- Click ```Join Now```.
- Click the three dots in the top right-hand corner, also called ```More Actions```.
- If you are not using an avatar of yourself and would like to use a background while recording, select ```apply background effects``` and select one or upload your own, then hit ```apply```.
- Click ```Start Recording.```
- Start your PowerPoint slide show.  It should appear in the window you're sharing because you already checked it earlier.
- If you have an empty slide as I suggested, wait for a few seconds of silence and then start talking when you're ready.  Click to go to the next slide as you finish talking about each slide or window.
- Hit the ```esc``` key to exit the PowerPoint slide when you need to show a different window.
- The app/code you need should be the top window and, in theory, you shouldn't need to do much traversing between apps/windows while recording.
- Finish recording your video.  This may take several tries.
- Click ```Stop Recording```.
- Click the red ```Leave``` button.
- Now, Teams should be already showing the 'posts' tab, but if it's not, go there now by clicking ```Posts``` in the top center toolbar.
- At the bottom of this screen, you'll see a note about the 'meeting' you just had and the recording you just made.
- Wait for it to finish uploading to Microsoft Streams.
- When it's complete, click the three dots and select ```Open in Microsoft Stream```.
- You can do trims of the beginning or ending here, and honestly it's easier here than in Premiere Pro, so although you can do it in Premiere Pro, if you want to trim off some part of the beginning or end here, click the three dots and select ```Trim Video```.
- Otherwise, click the three dots and select ```Download Video```.

Now you're ready to edit and compile what you just made!
